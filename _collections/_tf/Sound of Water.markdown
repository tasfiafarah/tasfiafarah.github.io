Sound of Water
The sound of water dripping from the tap reaches your eardrum. The water drips all the time, but you can only hear it at night, when everything gets quiet with the peacefulness of dark. You have counted the number of drips in a minute. It’s eleven drips a minute. Is the water dripping too slow? The sound of drips gets louder and louder at night, just like your thought.<!--more--> 

The answer you knew in today’s class but didn’t say it.
what if I was wrong? It would have been so disgraceful!

The interview you had one week ago. 
That was so embarrassing! You could have done better!

The presentation you had two months ago. 
What did you even say? That was so humiliating! 

The research idea you have.
They will laugh after reading it. You will just shame yourself!

The writings you have in your draft.
Why bother publishing them? They are not good enough!

The project you deleted. 
Thank God, you deleted it. That was so foolish! 

The book you bought the other day.
 You don’t learn anything from it. 
Besides, who reads fiction now a days anyway, right? At least that’s what they say! 

The painting you wanted to make.
Your painting is horrendous!

The violin lesson you wanted to take.
What if I am not good enough? That would be agonizing!

Debating you were so passionate about.
What if I say something improper? That would be ignominious!

The water that is dripping and needs fixing. 
What if you break the rhythm? That would be cacophonical!


Is the water dripping too fast?
