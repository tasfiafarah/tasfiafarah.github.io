What is spirituality? Why do we become spiritual? What are the facets that drive us to spirituality? Is it our happiness or our sadness? People who are happy, do they turn to god because they are happy?<!--more--> Do they sow the seeds of their spiritual journey because they want to be grateful towards god? Because their worldly life is content and now they want to focus on their spiritual life? Do they feel the need to be spiritual at all? Do people who are happy turn to God at all? Or is it only the people in demise that turn to God? Is it only the sufferers that need spiritual life? Why do the sufferers turn to god? Is it because they need support to persist in their life? Is it because they are not content in their worldly life, so at least they want to be happy in the hereafter? Or is it because they are seeking justification for their demise? Is it because there is nothing to hold onto? Is it because there is nothing they can get hope from? Is it because spirituality is their last hope? Then how does it become spirituality? How is it spirituality when they are turning into it because there is nothing else? How is spirituality when sufferers are turning into it only because they need it? How is it spirituality when they are manoeuvring it to end unto itself?
What is spirituality?
